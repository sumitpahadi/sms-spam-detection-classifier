Spam Detection Classifier using Machine Learning:
The spam detection classifier project aims to develop a machine learning model that can identify and filter out spam emails. The project will involve collecting a large dataset of emails, including both spam and legitimate emails. The data will be preprocessed and used to train a machine learning model using classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. The project aims to create a tool that can accurately detect spam emails and filter them out of the user's inbox. This will not only save time for the user but also improve the security of the user's email account by preventing phishing attacks.

The project will involve data cleaning and preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. Additionally, feature engineering techniques will be used to extract meaningful features from the email data such as email subject, sender, message body, and attachments. The model will be trained on these features and will be able to classify new emails as either spam or legitimate.

The spam detection classifier project has applications in email filtering systems for personal and business use. It can also be used in other text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and customer feedback analysis. The end goal of the project is to create an accurate and reliable spam detection classifier that can be used to improve email security and efficiency
